## Project Description
This project implements a high-frequency blink using the onboard LED of the **Arduino UNO R4**. The goal is to demonstrate the board's functionality and investigate the **Persistence of Vision (POV)** threshold.

## Technical Details
* **Target Hardware:** Arduino UNO R4 WiFi
* **Active Component:** Onboard LED (`LED_BUILTIN`)
* **Blink Frequency:** The firmware is set with a constant delay of **20ms** (modify the `BLINK_DELAY` variable to test different thresholds).
